Given this regex pattern: `{regex_pattern}`

You are an expert in regular expressions and regex golf. Your task is to generate high-quality training examples for a machine learning model that learns to create efficient regex patterns.

Regex golf is about finding the shortest possible regex that matches specific target strings while avoiding non-target strings.

Generate training examples with the following requirements:

1. Create 6-10 strings that SHOULD match this pattern (yes examples)
2. Create 6-10 strings that should NOT match this pattern (no examples)

Guidelines for examples:
- Make them realistic and diverse
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Cover different scenarios the regex might encounter
- Be educational for learning regex patterns
- Test different aspects of the pattern (literal matches, character classes, quantifiers, anchors, etc.)
- Include both obvious cases and subtle edge cases
- Make sure examples are correct and well-tested

For the "yes" examples:
- Include minimal cases that just barely match
- Include maximal cases that fully utilize the pattern
- Include variations that test different parts of the regex
- Include real-world examples when applicable

For the "no" examples:
- Include near-misses that almost match but don't
- Include completely different strings
- Include strings that might fool a naive implementation
- Include empty strings, single characters, and longer strings as appropriate

Return ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:
{{
  "expr": "REGEX_PATTERN_HERE",
  "yes": ["string1", "string2", "string3", ...],
  "no": ["string1", "string2", "string3", ...]
}}

Replace REGEX_PATTERN_HERE with the exact regex pattern provided above.
Make sure the JSON is valid and parseable. Do not include any other text, explanation, or commentary.
